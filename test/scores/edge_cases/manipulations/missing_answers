In this file, multiple answers are missing.

________________________________________________________________________________

1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

________________________________________________________________________________

3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

    [X] $_
    [ ] @_
    [ ] $$
    [ ] $=
    [ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to

________________________________________________________________________________


4. You can access the command-line arguments of a Perl program via:

    [X] @ARGV
    [ ] $ARGV
    [ ] @ARGS
    [ ] @ARG
    [ ] @_

________________________________________________________________________________


5. The main repository for Open Source Perl modules is:

    [X] CPAN
    [ ] CSPAN
    [ ] Github
    [ ] Perlhub
    [ ] www.perl.org

________________________________________________________________________________


2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [X] List, scalar, and void
    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] List, scalar, and null
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears

________________________________________________________________________________


6. The three standard sigils for variable declarations are:


    [ ] '$' for numeric, '@' for emails, '%' for percentages
    [ ] '$' for lookups, '@' for reuses, '%' for declarations

________________________________________________________________________________


8. A single-quoted string (such as: 'I will achieve 100% on this exam')...

    [X] ...does not interpolate variables or backslashed escape sequences

    [ ] ...only interpolates backslashed escape sequences, but not variables

    [ ] ...converts its contents to ASCII, even if they are Unicode characters

________________________________________________________________________________


9. The term qq{XXXXX} is...

    [X] ...another way of writing the double-quoted string: "XXXXX"
    [ ] ...another way of writing the single-quoted string: 'XXXXX'
    [ ] ...another way of writing the list of strings:  ('X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X')
    [ ] ...another way of writing the array of strings: ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X']
    [ ] ...a call to the 'qq' function, passing it a block of code

________________________________________________________________________________


10. Which of the following is NOT a single valid Perl number?

    [X] 1'042


    [ ] 1.042e3
    [ ] 0b10000010010

________________________________________________________________________________


11. An array is...

    [X] A container for a list
    [ ] Exactly the same as a list
    [ ] Something that is always contained in a list
    [ ] A list with a predeclared fixed number of elements
    [ ] A multidimensional list

________________________________________________________________________________


12. An 'if' statement requires curly brackets around the statements it controls...

    [X] ...in all circumstances
    [ ] ...only if it controls exactly one statement
    [ ] ...only if it controls two or more statements

    [ ] ...never; the curly brackets are always optional in an 'if' statement

________________________________________________________________________________


13. To specify a second alternative test after an 'if', the correct keyword is:

    [X] elsif
    [ ] elseif  (with no whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] else if (with any amount of whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] elif
    [ ] ormaybe (with no whitespace between the two words)

________________________________________________________________________________


14. "Short-circuiting" of a boolean expression means...

    [X] ...Perl evaluates as little as required to get a definite answer
    [ ] ...Perl only evaluates each boolean expression once during the program
    [ ] ...Perl will never execute an 'else' block
    [ ] ...Perl programs can cause CPUs to spark if an expression is too complex

________________________________________________________________________________


15. A "foreach-style" loop (such as: for (@list) {...}) will be iterated...

    [X] ...once per element in the list, unless a 'last' is executed in the block
    [ ] ...once per element in the list in all circumstances
    [ ] ...endlessly, until a 'last' is executed in the loop
    [ ] ...an unknown number of times, until the list being iterated is empty
    [ ] ...never, because an array is not a list and cannot be iterated

________________________________________________________________________________


7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

    [X] 'my' variables are lexically scoped; 'our' variables are package scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are compile-time; 'our' variables are run-time
    [ ] 'my' variables must be scalars; 'our' variables must be arrays or hashes
    [ ] 'my' variables are assignable; 'our' variables are constants

________________________________________________________________________________


16. The 'while' loop in Perl...

    [X] ...iterates until its condition is false
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition is true at the start of an iteration
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes false anywhere within its block
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes true anywhere within its block
    [ ] ...doesn't exist; Perl does not have a 'while' loop

________________________________________________________________________________


18. Which five Perl values are the only values that evaluate false?

    [X] 0, '0', '', (), undef
    [ ] 0, '0', '', (), []

________________________________________________________________________________


19. If the array @x contains four elements,
    how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

    [X] Six:   the four array elements will be flattened into the list
    [ ] Eight: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8


    [ ] None:  it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors

________________________________________________________________________________


20. A hash variable stores...

    [X] Values of any scalar type, indexed by keys that are always strings
    [ ] Values of any scalar or list type, indexed by keys that are always strings
    [ ] Values that are always strings, indexed by keys of any type
    [ ] Values that are unique, indexed by keys that may be repeated
    [ ] Random values, indexed by sequential keys of any type

________________________________________________________________________________

17. The keywords for the Perl switch statement are:

    [X] 'given'  and 'when'    and 'default'
    [ ] 'switch' and 'case'    and 'else'
    [ ] 'gather' and 'take'    and 'otherwise'
    [ ] 'case'   and 'of'      and 'or'
    [ ] 'whence' and 'whither' and 'thither'
