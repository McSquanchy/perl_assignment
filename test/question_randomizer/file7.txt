1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

19. If the array @x contains four elements,
    1. how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

    [X] Six:   the four array elements will be flattened into the list
    [ ] Eight: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
    [ ] Three: the array will become a single element within the list
    [ ] Two:   Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor
    [ ] None:  it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors

    [ ] Eight: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
    [ ] Three: the array will become a single element within the list
    [ ] Two:   Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor

17. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

34. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [ R  ] List, linear, and void
    [] List, scalar, and null
    [C] List, scalar, and void
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears

4. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type

    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

8. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] List, scalar, and null
    [   X    ] List, scalar, and void
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears


Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box beside each correct
answer, like so:

Scoring: Each question is worth 2 points.
         Final score will be: SUM / 10

Warning: Each question has only one correct answer. Answers to questions
         for which two or more boxes are marked with an 'X' will be scored as zero.
